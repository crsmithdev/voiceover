/**
 * Collects streamed words to the end of a sentence (spec 3.5).
 *
 * The point is latency: the voice speaks one sentence while the brain still
 * writes the next, so the time to the first audio is the time to the first
 * sentence, not the time to the whole reply (spec 3.4).
 *
 * Splitting too eagerly costs a small pause. Splitting too late holds the
 * audio back. This errs toward splitting, and never waits for punctuation
 * that may not arrive.
 *
 * Taken from sidetone src/sentences.ts, where it already runs against
 * a live model. The two products want the same rule, so they keep the same
 * code until one of them needs to differ.
